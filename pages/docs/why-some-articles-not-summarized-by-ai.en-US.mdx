If you use AI, you can see that there may still be some articles inside the digest that are not summarized by AI. This is because the content of the articles that are fetched via RSS are not the original content, and may only be an summary. Therefore, Tidyread will not summarize the content with less than 100 characters, but use the original content directly.

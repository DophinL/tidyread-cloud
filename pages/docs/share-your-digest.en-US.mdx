Tidyread supports the sharing of digests through [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/).

Therefore, you need to register an account on a website built with WriteFreely, and then add your account information in Tidyread to start sharing digests.

## Configuring WriteFreely

The default endpoint is [paper.wf](https://paper.wf). Click to register an account, and then enter the username and password into the Tidyread settings page.

If you are using your own or a community WriteFreely website, you will need to change the endpoint to your own WriteFreely website address, and after registering an account, fill in the information.

## Verifying The Effect

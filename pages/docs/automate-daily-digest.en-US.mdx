To automate the generation and pushing of digests, we need to do two things:

-   Set the push time.
-   Enable automatic push.

## Setting the Push Time

Go to the Tidyread Extension settings page, find the `Notification Time` field, and enter your desired daily push time, such as `9:30am`, `21:00`, etc.:

## Enabling Automatic Push

Open Raycast, search for the Tidyread `Auto Digest` command, press the `Enter` key, and you can start automatic push according to the push time set earlier:

## Limitations

Notifications will only hover for a while by default. This means they will show up on the system and disappear from the screen after a second or two, remaining only in the notification center.

To change the behavior of system notifications, making them stay on screen until you dismiss them, you need to do two things:

> 1. Open `System Preferences`, go to `Notifications & Focus`.

> 2. Enter `Script Editor`, change the notification type from `Banner` to `Alerts`.

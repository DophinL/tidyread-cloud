In the previous section, we mentioned that without any configuration, the content in the digest defaults to the original content.

If we summarize this content using AI, it will further enhance our reading efficiency.

If there's an `AI Summarized` tag in the digest, it means the digest has been summarized using AI.

## Configuring AI

First, go to the `Settings Page` => `Extensions`, and find Tidyread:

### OpenAI

By default, OpenAI is used as the provider for AI summary. Configuration is as follows:

### Raycast AI

<Callout type="warning">
    If you are not a `Raycast Pro` member, you will be unable to use Raycast AI.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
    If your membership does not include gpt-4, using gpt-4 will automatically downgrade to 3.5.

## Summary Prompt

The default summary is:

```md copy
## Target

summarize the contents

## Requirements

-   Output a minimum of 50 characters, maximum of 200 characters

-   Remove from the summary any references to author publicity and promotion.

-   Output the summarized content in a straightforward manner, without restating the requirements.

## Respond Language

Respond in the language of the user input content, not the language of the prompt itself.
```

You can customize the summary prompt in the configuration:

## Considerations

If you find that some articles fail to summarize, it is usually due to exceeding the rate limit. Try adjusting the API Concurrency to `1`:

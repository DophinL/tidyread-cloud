In the previous section, we mentioned that without any configuration, the content in the digest defaults to the original content.

If we summarize this content using AI, it will further enhance our reading efficiency.

If there's an `AI Summarized` tag in the digest, it means the digest has been summarized using AI.

## Configuring AI

First, go to the `Settings Page` => `Extensions`, and find Tidyread:
![setting](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/setting.png)

### Raycast AI

By default, Raycast AI is used as the provider for AI summary.
Configuration is as follows:
![raycast](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/raycast_config.png)

<Callout type="warning">
    If you are not a `Raycast Pro` member, you will be unable to use Raycast AI.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
    If your membership does not include gpt-4, using gpt-4 will automatically
    downgrade to 3.5.
</Callout>

### OpenAI

Configuration is as follows:

![openai](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai_config.png)

### Moonshot AI

Configuration is as follows:

![raycast](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/moonshot_config.png)

## Summary Prompt

The default summary is:

```md copy
Summarize the content within 50 to 200 characters, excluding any references to author publicity and promotion. The summary should be straightforward and in {{lang}}.
```

You can customize the summary prompt in the configuration:
![prompt](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prompt_setting.png)

## Verify The Effect

Once configured, try generating the digest again to see the effect:

![ai_summarized](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/digest_with_ai.png)

If you find that some article summaries fail, it's usually because the frequency limit is exceeded. Try modifying the API Concurrency to `1`:

![api_concur](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/api_concur.png)

As we can see from the effect just now, the title and content of the article in the digest are in the language of the original, is it possible to translate it into a language we are more familiar with? Please see the next section.

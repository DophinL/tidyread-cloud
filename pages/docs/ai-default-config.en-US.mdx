<Callout type="warning">
    Currently, due to default configurations, there's an issue with the Digest
    generation being too slow. Please refer to the following temporary settings,
    and wait for the [Bugfix](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pull/10357)
    to be reviewed and released for a final resolution. However, if the number
    of articles is too large (e.g., over 40), it might still take a few minutes.
    It's recommended to enable the [automatic generation of
    Digest](/docs/automate-daily-digest) feature to avoid waiting.
</Callout>

The new [PR](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pull/10357) not only optimizes configurations and generation performance but also adds a progress page to give you a clear view of the current generation progress. Stay tuned:

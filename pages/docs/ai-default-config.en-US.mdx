    Due to the default configuration, there is currently an issue with the
    Digest generation being slow. Please refer to the following settings for a
    temporary solution, and wait for the Bugfix to be reviewed and released for
    a final resolution. However, if the number of articles is too large, it may
    still take a few minutes. It is recommended that you enable the [automatic
    generation of Digest](/docs/automate-daily-digest) feature to avoid
    waiting.

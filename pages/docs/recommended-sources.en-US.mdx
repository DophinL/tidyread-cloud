## Recommended RSS For Onboarding

When you first enter Tidyread's `Manage Sources` command, you will be directed to the `Onboarding` page:

![onboarding](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/onboarding.png)

Tidyread will automatically generate recommended reading sources based on the information you provide.

Below are the current recommended sources. If needed, you can copy any of the `sources` arrays from a section and import it in the `Manage Sources` command:

<Pre lang="json" hasCopyCode>
  <Code lang="json">{JSON.stringify(recommendedSources, null, 2)}</Code>
</Pre>

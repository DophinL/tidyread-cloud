In the previous chapter, we discussed how to export. Importing involves using the exported data.

The method is to enter the `Manage Source List` command, invoke Actions for any reading source, and perform the following operation:

![batch_import_sources_action](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/batch_import_sources_action.png)

Then proceed with the import:
![batch_import_sources](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/batch_import_sources.png)

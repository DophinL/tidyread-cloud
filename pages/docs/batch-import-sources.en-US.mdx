## Importing Using Exported Data

The previous chapter discussed how to export data. Importing involves using the exported data.

The method is to enter the `Manage Sources` command, invoke Actions for any reading source, and perform the following operations:

![batch_import_sources_action](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/batch_import_sources_action.png)

After copying the exported data into the textarea, use `cmd + Enter` to save:
![batch_import_sources](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/batch_import_sources.png)

<Callout type="info">
    Validation will take some time (mainly due to RSS Link verification), please be patient.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
    If the import fails, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.tidyread.info/docs/why-digest-failed#network-blocking) for troubleshooting.
</Callout>

## Manual Entry for Import

Normally, reading sources are entered through the `Add Source` form. If you find this cumbersome and want to import in bulk, you can refer to the following type (Question mark represent non-required field). Content written in the textarea needs to conform to `Source[]` (it must be an array):

```typescript
export interface Source {
    url: string;
    title: string;
    // default is "everyday"
    schedule?: "everyday" | "custom";
    customDays?: (
        | "Mondy"
        | "Tuesday"
        | "Wednesday"
        | "Thursday"
        | "Friday"
        | "Saturday"
        | "Sunday"
    )[];
    rssLink?: string;
    // Time span of the content pulled by rss, default is "1", means one day
    timeSpan?: string;
    tags?: string[];
    // favicon url
    favicon?: string;
}
```

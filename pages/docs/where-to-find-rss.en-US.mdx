There are many ways to obtain a website's RSS feed, and it's generally easy to find one through a search engine.

A more convenient method is through [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes), where you're likely to find the RSS feed you're looking for.

Additionally, you can download the [RSSHub Radar Chrome Extension](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes), which automatically detects the RSS feeds of websites you visit, making it very convenient.

Some other methods you can try:

## Validating RSS Feed

You can validate the RSS feed through the [W3C Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/).

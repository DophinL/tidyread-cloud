There are several ways to obtain a website's RSS feed. Generally, you can start by searching through a search engine:
![google_search](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/google_search_rss.png)

If you can't find it there, try [Rss Finder](https://rssfinder.app/).

Or [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes).

Additionally, you can download the [RSSHub Radar Chrome Extension](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes), which can automatically detect the RSS of the website you're on, though it's not always comprehensive.

Some other methods you might try:

-   [RSS App](https://rss.app/), which can create RSS for any website, but it's a paid service.

## Validating RSS Feed

You can validate the RSS feed through the [W3C Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/).

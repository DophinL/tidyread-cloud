The first thing you can do is to see if any of the [builtin recommended sources](/docs/recommended-sources) are of interest to you.

There are several ways to obtain a website's RSS feed. Generally, you can start by searching through a search engine:
![google_search](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/google_search_rss.png)

If you can't find it there, try [Rss Finder](https://rssfinder.app/).

Or [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes).

Additionally, you can download the [RSSHub Radar Chrome Extension](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes), which can automatically detect the RSS of the website you're on, though it's not always comprehensive.

Some other methods you might try:

- [Migor RSS Proxy](https://rssproxy.migor.org), can create RSS for any website, free of charge.
- [Feedfry](https://feedfry.com/), can create RSS for any website, 5 free, additional ones require payment.
- [RSS App](https://rss.app/), can create RSS for any website, requires payment.

## Validating RSS Feed

You can validate the RSS feed through the [W3C Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/).

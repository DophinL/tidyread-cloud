If you have any concerns, Tidyread's code is completely open source. You can visit the [Tidyread GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DophinL/raycast-extensions/tree/ext/tidyread---streamline-your-daily-reading/extensions/tidyread---streamline-your-daily-reading) to review it.

Additionally, when opening links in the digest, it defaults to a Tidyread intermediary page. The purpose is to record how many people read through Tidyread, without involving any user privacy data. If you find this process intrusive, you can turn it off in the settings:

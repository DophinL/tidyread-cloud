## Background

Tidyread currently only offers a Raycast Extension. If you haven't installed Raycast yet, I strongly recommend you try it. You can download it from [here](https://raycast.com/).

## Installation

Install the [Tidyread Raycast Extension](https://www.raycast.com/jaredliu233/tidyread---streamline-your-daily-reading)

## Extension Overview

![commands](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tidyread_commands.png)

-   `Daily Read`: The most frequently used command, allowing you to view today's readings and digests.
-   `Manage Source List`: The second most used command, used for managing reading sources.
-   `Auto Digest`: If you wish to receive an automatically generated digest daily, press Enter once to activate it, and it will remain active until you manually deactivate it.
-   `Digest List`: Here you can view all the generated digests.
-   `Add Source`: Add a reading source, or do it directly in the `Manage Source List` command.

## Adding Your First Reading Source

![empty_list](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tidyread_empty_list.png)

Enter the `Manage Source List` command, and you'll see an empty list. Pressing Enter will trigger the creation of a reading source.

![add_source](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tidyread_add_source.png)

Only URL and Title are required fields, others are optional.
With the Schedule field, you can plan the reading time for this source, and it will appear in that day's `Daily Read`.

<Callout type="info">
    I recommend you fill in the RSS Link, as only then can this reading source be used to generate digests.

## Trying to Generate a Digest

Once it's generated, you can view the digest in `Daily Read`. Click Enter to view the details of the digest:

Since there are currently no AI-related settings configured, all content in the digest is original and has not been summarized by AI.

By now, you have used the basic functions of Tidyread. If you wish to further enhance your reading experience, please continue reading.

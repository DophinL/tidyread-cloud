## Automating Digest Generation

You actually don't need to manually generate digests. You can specify a time for the digest to be automatically generated based on the day's reading sources and push notifications to you. For more information, refer to [this document](/docs/automate-daily-digest).

## How to Make Digest Generation Faster?

If the digest is being generated automatically, there's no need for optimization. However, if you're generating it manually, waiting too long can be frustrating, even though it's asynchronous and doesn't block other activities.

For manual generation, you can adjust the following parameters:

`Max Items Per RSS Feed` indicates how many articles are fetched from each reading source at a time. The smaller this value, the fewer articles to summarize, and the faster the speed.

`Max Summarize API Concurrency` represents how many summary APIs are called simultaneously. The larger this value, the faster the speed, but it is subject to the limitations of the AI Provider, like `Moonshot AI` currently only allows a concurrency of 3.
Moreover, AI Providers generally limit the maximum number of calls within a minute, so you might also need to adjust the `API Retry` related settings to avoid final article summary failures:

## Make Digest Easier To Read
With the following configuration, you can make the digest more readable by displaying it in parts:

## Shortcuts

The command we use most daily is `Daily Read`. You can set a global shortcut for it to enhance your efficiency:

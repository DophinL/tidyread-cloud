## API Rate Limiting

The issue might be due to reaching the `Rate Limit`:

AI Providers typically limit the maximum number of calls within a minute. You can adjust the `API Retry` related settings to avoid article summary failures:

## Content To Be Summarized Is Too Long

You can try to switch to another API Model.

## Content Moderation Failure

AI interfaces generally include content moderation. If the content does not meet the requirements, it may also lead to failure.

There are several possibilities for issues encountered:

## Network Blocking

Fetching RSS data and calling AI interfaces both require a network connection. If the network is blocked, you can try using a proxy:

## Excessive Execution Time

Please refer to [this document](/docs/use-like-a-pro#如何让简报更快地生成).

## Unknown Raycast Error

If you are manually generating a digest and temporarily close the Raycast window, it may occasionally interrupt without throwing any errors. This issue needs to be fixed by Raycast officially. If you encounter this, one solution is to keep the Raycast window open until the generation is complete.
The best solution is to use the auto-generation feature, as detailed in [this document](/docs/automate-daily-digest).

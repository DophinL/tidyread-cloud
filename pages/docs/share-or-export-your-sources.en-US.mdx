Sometimes, we might be curious about what others are reading, or we might want to share our own reading list. In such cases, we can share or export our reading sources.

This functionality still relies on the support of [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/). For specific configuration methods, please refer to the content in the previous chapter.

How to use it: Enter the `Manage Source List` command, invoke Actions for any reading source, and select one of the following operations:
![export_sources](https://tidyread.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/export_sources.png)

If sharing, a `WriteFreely` link will be generated; if exporting, the content must be manually copied.

The format of the exported content is as follows:

```json copy
[
    {
        "rssLink": "https://www.producthunt.com/feed",
        "title": "PH Deck",
        "schedule": "custom",
        "timeSpan": "1",
        "url": "https://www.phdeck.com/",
        "tags": [],
        "favicon": "https://www.phdeck.com/favicon.ico",
        "customDays": ["Friday"]
    },
    {
        "schedule": "everyday",
        "title": "The New York Times",
        "timeSpan": "1",
        "tags": [],
        "rssLink": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml",
        "url": "https://www.nytimes.com",
        "favicon": "https://www.nytimes.com/vi-assets/static-assets/favicon-d2483f10ef688e6f89e23806b9700298.ico",
        "customDays": ["Friday"]
    },
    {
        "schedule": "everyday",
        "rssLink": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss",
        "tags": [],
        "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/",
        "timeSpan": "1",
        "title": "Hacker News",
        "favicon": "https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.svg",
        "customDays": ["Friday"]
    }
]
```

## Next Steps

With the ability to export, naturally, there's also the possibility to import. In the next chapter, we will introduce how to import.
